    <h3>Early history</h3>
    <p><em>A <strong>superhero</strong> (sometimes rendered <strong>super-hero</strong> or <strong>super hero</strong>) is a type of heroic stock character who possesses supernatural
        or superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling supervillains.
        A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine (also rendered super-heroine or super heroine), although the
        word superhero is commonly used for females also. Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such
        characters, especially in American comic books since the 1930s.</p></em>
        <p>By most definitions, characters do not require actual superhuman powers or phenomena to be deemed superheroes.<sup>[1][2][3]</sup>            While the Dictionary.com definition of "superhero" is "a figure, especially in a comic strip or cartoon, endowed
            with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime",<sup>[4]</sup> the longstanding Merriam-Webster
            dictionary gives the definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; also: an exceptionally
            skillful or successful person".[5] Terms such as masked crime fighters, costumed adventurers or masked vigilantes
            are sometimes used to refer to characters such as the Spirit, who may not be explicitly referred to as superheroes
            but nevertheless share similar traits.</p>
        <p>The ideas of second-wave feminism, which spread through the 1960s into the 1970s, greatly influenced the way comic
            book companies would depict as well as market their female characters: Wonder Woman was for a time revamped as
            a mod-dressing martial artist directly inspired by the Emma Peel character from the British television series
            The Avengers (no relation to the superhero team of the same name),[26] but later reverted to Marston's original
            concept after the editors of Ms. magazine publicly disapproved of the character being depowered and without her
            traditional costume;[27] Supergirl was moved from being a secondary feature on Action Comics to headline Adventure
            Comics in 1969; the Lady Liberators appeared in an issue of The Avengers as a group of mind-controlled superheroines
            led by Valkyrie (actually a disguised supervillainess) and were meant to be a caricatured parody of feminist
            activists;[28] and Jean Grey became the embodiment of a cosmic being known as the Phoenix Force with seemingly
            unlimited power in the late 1970s, a stark contrast from her depiction as the weakest member of her team a decade
            ago.
        </p>
        <p>Some superheroes use their powers to counter daily crime while also combating threats against humanity from supervillains,
            who are their criminal counterparts. Often at least one of these supervillains will be the superhero's archenemy.
            Some long-running superheroes such as Batman, Spider-Man, Superman, Captain America, Wonder Woman, Iron Man,
            the Flash, Wolverine, Green Lantern, and Hulk have a rogues gallery of many villains.</p>
        <p>In 1972, the Science Ninja Team Gatchaman anime debuted, which built upon the superhero team idea of the live-action
            Phantom Agents as well as introducing different colors for team members and special vehicles to support them,
            said vehicles could also combine into a larger one. Another important event was the debut of Mazinger Z by Go
            Nagai, creating the Super Robot genre. Go Nagai also wrote the manga Cutey Honey in 1973, although the Magical
            Girl genre already existed, Nagai's manga introduced Transformation sequences that would become a staple of Magical
            Girl media.</p>
